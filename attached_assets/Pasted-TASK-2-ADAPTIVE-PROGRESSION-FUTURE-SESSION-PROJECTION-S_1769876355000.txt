TASK 2 — ADAPTIVE PROGRESSION & FUTURE SESSION PROJECTION
SYSTEM DIRECTIVE

You are now implementing Task 2: Adaptive Progression Execution.

Task 1 established domain integrity.
Task 2 must make the system actually adaptive.

You are NOT allowed to:

Change UI styling or layout

Add new frameworks

Add new user inputs

Change onboarding

Change storage strategy

Add “AI magic” in place of logic

This task is pure behavior.

CORE PROBLEM (TO FIX)

The system currently:

Accepts user performance data (weight, RPE)

Evaluates it in isolation

Fails to project changes into future sessions

This breaks the core promise of the app.

Your mission is to make future days update automatically.

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. Deterministic Projection Engine

After every completed session:

The system MUST recalculate:

The next 2 upcoming sessions minimum

For the same movement patterns

Using the active TrainingFramework rules

This is NOT optional.
If projections are missing, the system is broken.

2. Framework-Specific Adaptation Rules

Use pure functions only.
No randomness. No heuristics without justification.

Examples (illustrative, not optional):

STRENGTH_LINEAR

ON_TARGET RPE → +2.5kg next exposure

UNDER RPE → +5kg

OVER RPE → −2.5kg or repeat load

HYPERTROPHY

ON_TARGET → add 1 set OR +2 reps

UNDER → add volume first, load second

OVER → reduce volume, preserve load

POWERLIFTING

Adapt intensity (%1RM proxy)

Respect wave structure

No blind linear jumps

STRENGTH_CONDITIONING

Adapt density or rest intervals

Load changes are secondary

These rules must live in a single progression engine, not scattered.

3. Data Flow Contract (CRITICAL)

Implement this exact flow:

User logs session (weight, reps, sets, RPE)

Session is marked complete

Progression engine evaluates performance

Engine mutates future DayEntries

Future sessions reflect updated prescriptions

If step 4 does not happen, the task has failed.

4. Guardrails

Never overwrite completed sessions

Never modify past data

Framework change must still trigger re-baseline

Projections must be idempotent (no double stacking on reload)

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

You must:

Identify where future sessions are generated

Introduce a post-session projection hook

Ensure projections persist (local + backend)

Keep logic testable and deterministic

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

At the end, provide:

A clear explanation of:

Where adaptation was previously broken

How future sessions are now recalculated

A concrete example:

Session A logged → Session B & C changed

A list of files modified (logic only)

Do NOT mention UI.
Do NOT mention aesthetics.
Do NOT suggest future tasks.

QUALITY BAR

This app markets itself as:

“Adaptive training based on performance.”

After this task:

That statement must be objectively true

No manual refresh tricks

No fake “AI analysis” without consequences

Numbers must move

If you cannot guarantee forward adaptation, stop and say so.
