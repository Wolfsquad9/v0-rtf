TASK 3 — RESPONSIVE STRUCTURE ONLY (NO VISUAL REDESIGN)

You are a senior front-end engineer working on a production web app.

The UI aesthetic is already approved.
You are NOT allowed to redesign anything.

GOAL

Make the existing application fully responsive and layout-safe across:

Mobile (≤ 640px)

Tablet (641–1024px)

Desktop (≥ 1025px)

WITHOUT changing:

colors

typography

component visuals

spacing scale

copy

business logic

planner behavior

SCOPE (STRICT)

You may ONLY:

Fix layout breakage

Add responsive containers

Add breakpoints

Adjust grid / flex behavior

Prevent overflow, clipping, or horizontal scroll

Stack elements vertically on small screens when necessary

You may NOT:

introduce new UI components

change hierarchy

hide functionality

simplify features

add mobile-only UX logic

This is structural responsiveness, not UX redesign.

CONCRETE REQUIREMENTS
Layout

Replace rigid widths with responsive containers

Use max-widths instead of fixed widths

Ensure main content never exceeds viewport width

Ensure cards wrap instead of overflow

Grids & Flex

Desktop: preserve existing multi-column layouts

Tablet: reduce columns conservatively

Mobile: single-column stacking, in logical order

Forms & Panels

Inputs must be usable on mobile

Panels must stack vertically on small screens

No side-by-side panels below tablet width

Navigation

Must remain usable on small screens

No redesign, only stacking or collapsing if already supported

IMPLEMENTATION RULES

Use existing styling system (Tailwind / CSS)

Use standard breakpoints (sm, md, lg)

Prefer CSS over JS

No inline styles

No media-query chaos

FILES YOU MAY TOUCH

Layout containers (layout.tsx, main wrappers)

Page-level components

Structural component wrappers

You may NOT modify:

domain logic

planner state

progression engine

AI logic

OUTPUT REQUIRED

When finished, respond with:

Exact files modified

What responsive changes were applied (bullet list)

Confirmation that:

No visual redesign occurred

No behavior changed

No logic was touched

FINAL RULE

If something already works responsively, do nothing.
Stability beats cleverness.
